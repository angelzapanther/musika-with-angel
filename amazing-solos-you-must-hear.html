               <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byii_k4cvm8">The Death of a Violin</a>. That sounds tragic.

            <p>The viola is the classic middle child of the orchestral string family. It's not as famous as it's "younger" sibling, the violin, or it's "older" sibling, the cello, <br> <br>But here are the 5 <em>amazing</em> viola pieces.</p>
             
             <ol>

               <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOFfTFw6a2U">Kugel's Prelude-Ysaye</a> performed by Dana Zemtsov which showcases the viola's darker and temperamental side.</li><br>
               
               <li>This viola <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaLULXrnacE">"Tango"</a> is composed by Francisco de Asís Tárrega y Eixea, a Spanish composer and clasical guitarist.

               <li>Continuing the Spanish theme, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2iMwADNmRk">R. Strauss - Don Quixote</a> performed by Amahai Grosz shows off the viola's more playful side. </li><br>
               
               <li>The violinist and violist Max Baillie performs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9j2fNPRiZ8"> Bach's "Chromatic Fantasia and Fuguein D minor</a> on the viola, duh!
